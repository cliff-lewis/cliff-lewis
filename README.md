- Hi, I’m @cliff-lewis
- I’m interested in data science and data analytics, and I'm creating this to hopefully be able to share my portfolio with all of you who stop by.
- I've just finished up a Google Advanced Data Analytics course and I'm bringing over my project from there. It has given me tons of insights to more advanced analytics techniques
  as well as classic machine learning methods, and it was fun to see some of the statistics that I learned at Arizona State be computed instantly in Python.
- You can reach me at cliffclewis@gmail.com
